# Atrytone audit-chain anchor

Atrytone keeps an append-only, hash-chained audit log of every governed
action it takes. This file publishes that chain's head into this
repository — somewhere Atrytone does not control — so that the record can
be checked by someone who does not have to take Atrytone's word for it.

It is written by Atrytone's broker, not by the agent that produced the
change in this push. The agent cannot omit it, and cannot write it: the
path is reserved, and a push whose payload contains it is refused.

## The anchor

```
chain head sequence      30863
chain head hash          1b80a46be5b552feaf230c0c0c3dcb69fb989ea5e4fb95e8be166d0c33d56759

## The previous anchor, so a gap is visible

```
previous head sequence   30823
previous head hash       c8ae640be9b5de7f9593d5a8b9a66037f303f94aac2c822f6e1972111a273b60
previous published at    2026-09-09T13:00:46.111Z
audit rows added since   40
```

Consecutive anchors form their own chain inside this repository. If the
gap above is larger than you expect, that is the point: it is how a
period with no anchor becomes visible instead of silent. Every previous
anchor is in this file's git history — `git log .conductor/audit-anchor.md`.

## What this proves

- Every audit row up to sequence 30863 hashes, in order, to the head
  hash above. Each row's hash covers the previous row's hash, so the
  sequence cannot be reordered, and no row can be removed from the middle
  without the following hashes disagreeing.
- This file is committed to this repository, so the hash above existed at
  this commit's date — a date recorded in this repository's history, which
  Atrytone does not administer and cannot rewrite.
- Therefore any later edit to any audit row at or below sequence 30863
  makes Atrytone's recomputed head disagree with the hash committed here,
  and the disagreement is detectable by anyone holding this file.

## What this does NOT prove

- It says nothing about rows written BEFORE the genesis above. 2180
  rows lost their run attribution before the chain existed, and that is
  unrepairable: the identifiers are gone and nothing recorded what they were.
- It does not prove COMPLETENESS. A chain shows that nothing recorded was
  changed. It cannot show that everything that happened was recorded.
- It does not reveal or prove the CONTENT of any row. The hash commits to
  the whole ledger; reading any part of it still requires Atrytone.
- The sequence number counts audit rows across EVERY Atrytone client, not
  only this one. It therefore discloses how many audit rows exist in total,
  and nothing about whose they are.
- It anchors MOMENTS, NOT TIME. A head is published when Atrytone's broker
  pushes to this repository, and at no other time. Between two anchors
  Atrytone was running and was not anchored here. Atrytone also has a
  fallback path in which its worker pushes directly, without the broker;
  such a push carries no anchor at all. Do not read the presence of this
  file on some commits as a guarantee that every commit has one.

## How to check it

1. Note the head hash and sequence above, and this commit's date.
2. Ask Atrytone to recompute the chain over the same range. Its
   `verify_audit_chain()` walks every row in sequence order, recomputing
   each row's hash from the row's own contents and the previous hash.
3. The head it produces for sequence 30863 must equal the hash above.
   If it does not, something at or below that sequence changed after this
   commit was made.
